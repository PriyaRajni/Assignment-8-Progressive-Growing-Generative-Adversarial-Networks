In a normal GAN, the generator always outputs full-resolution images, even in the early stages of training. It is reasonable to think that this strategy might not be optimal—the generator might be slow to learn high-level structures in the early stages of training because it is operating on complex, high-resolution images from the outset.<img width="468" height="80" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8685c45-7104-41b3-aaea-2d063bd9c380" />
